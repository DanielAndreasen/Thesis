# Figures
1. Over plot PHOENIX synthetic spectrum on top of Arcturus or the Sun
2. Add plot that shows how synthesis was used to select iron lines
3. Make a plot of `plot_fits` in action (preferably for HD 20010)

## Theory
More or less done. Still reconsidering the stellar structure part.

## Results
Write it
### Synthetic spectra
1. Over plot PHOENIX synthetic spectrum on top of Arcturus or the Sun
2. Calibrate loggf for the Sun using Marcs models
3. Overplot a synthetic spectrum made with MOOG+Marcs+VALD on Arcturus.
 * If the plot looks good, then make synthetic spectra with MOOG+Marcs around all Fe lines, add noise, and rederive parameters from that.

### EP cut
Calibrate loggf for SAND364 for Arcturus and redo the plot (dist.py)

## Conclusion/Future work
