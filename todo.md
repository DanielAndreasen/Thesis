# Figures
1. Over plot PHOENIX synthetic spectrum on top of Arcturus or the Sun
2. Add plot that shows how synthesis was used to select iron lines

## Theory
More or less done. Still reconsidering the stellar structure part.

## Results
Write it
### Synthetic spectra
1. Over plot PHOENIX synthetic spectrum on top of Arcturus or the Sun
2. Calibrate loggf for the Sun using Marcs models
3. Consider making synthetic spectra with MOOG+Marcs around all Fe lines, add noise, and rederive parameters from that.

### EP cut
Calibrate loggf for SAND364 for Arcturus and redo the plot (dist.py)

## Conclusion/Future work
