\chapter{Spectrographs}
\label{cha:spectrographs}

This chapter will be focused on some of the available spectrographs for deriving
stellar atmospheric parameters using the method described in
\sref{sec:parameters}. For this we need a spectrum of both high resolution and
high signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, which combined will be called a high quality
spectrum. In order to get reliable results, a spectral resolution of at least
$R=\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=25\,000$ is needed. A $S/N\approx 100$ is at
least needed to obtain the parameters. These are approximately values since it
can vary across different spectral classes, e.g. it is often relatively easy to
obtain parameters of a solar-twin while it gets increasingly difficult as
especially $T_\mathrm{eff}$ diverges in either direction from the solar value.
Naturally the higher quality the spectrum is (both resolution and S/N), the
better the results will be obtained. It is common practise to increase the S/N
for a spectrum by co-adding a sample of lower S/N spectra of the same star from
the same spectrograph. This is often used if the star of interest is so dim that
it takes several observations to reach a sufficient high S/N. Another case is
when spectra have been obtained from the archive. The scientific goal can be
very different, e.g. obtaining radial velocities (RV) where a much lower S/N is
needed, however here numerous spectra are needed. It is common to search for
exoplanets with the RV detection method, where multiple spectra are obtained,
and the stellar parameters are then obtained after co-adding the multiple
spectra. It is of course important to put the spectra on a common RV, usually at
\SI{0}{km/s}.
